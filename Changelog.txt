V 2.0
Version 2.0 is here!

Version 2.0 brings an automatic updater
that checks for update at every launch
of the exe, this should help if dank
memer makes some slight changes to
the bot like the maximum amount of coins that
can be betted as it is hardcoded
and you had to go install another version manually
from the github  page, well the updater solves all that :)
Happy farming!
